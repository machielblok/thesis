The Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond has recently emerged as an excellent system to demonstrate quantum control of single spins. In this chapter we discuss its physical properties and the experimental techniques that form the basis of the results presented in chapters \ref{ch:AMC}-\ref{ch:CDL}. We first introduce the basic electronic structure and the detection of single NV centers in a confocal microscope setup (section \ref{sec:NVcenter}). In section \ref{sec:devices} we discuss the devices that enable optical initialization and single shot readout of the electron spin at low temperature (section \ref{sec:opticalcontrol}). The coherent control and characterization of the coherence times of the electron spin are presented in section \ref{sec:groundstatecontrol}. Finally we show how the coupling of the central spin to nearby nuclear spins allows us to extend our quantum register to multiple qubits.

\section{The NV center in diamond}
\label{sec:NVcenter}

The nitrogen vacancy center is a defect in the diamond lattice consisting of a substitutional nitrogen atom and a vacancy at an adjacent lattice position (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig1-nvstruct}). In its neutral charge state ($NV^{0}$) it hosts 5 electrons: 2 donor electrons from the nitrogen and 3 from the dangling bonds of the adjacent carbon atoms. Its negative charge state $NV^{-}$ is formed by capturing an electron from the environment. The experiments in this thesis are all performed on $NV^{-}$, which can be prepared experimentally as discussed in section \ref{sec:opticalcontrol}.

\begin{figure*}

The molecular orbitals are a linear combination of hybridised $sp^3$-orbitals. They are found by using the $C_{3v}$-symmetry of the NV center, taking into account the Coulomb interaction of the diamond nuclei and the lattice electrons with the electrons in the orbitals.}
\end{figure*}

In the electronic ground state, the 6 electrons occupy the molecular orbitals as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig1-nvstruct}b. Excluding electron-electron interactions, the electronic ground-, ($^2a^2e$) and excited ($^1a^3e$) state are spin degenerate. This degeneracy is lifted by the Coulomb interaction between the electrons which leads to spin triplet (S = 1) ground-, and excited states ($^3A_2$ and $^3E$ respectively) as well as multiple intermediate spin singlet levels. The $^3A_2$ to $^3E$ transition energy of 1.945 eV lies in the optical regime (637 nm), well within the bandgap of diamond (5.5eV). Since all experimental techniques in this thesis aim to control the NV center in the spin triplet manifold, we will not discuss the singlet levels in further detail. For a more detailed discussion of the electronic structure of the NV-center we refer to a recent review of Doherty \textit{et al} \cite{Doherty_PhysicsReports_2013}.

The NV centers are excited by focussing a green (532 nm) excitation laser onto the sample using a microscope objective (MO). The sample is mounted on a piezo-stage allowing three-dimensional scans. The emission is spectrally filtered using a dicroic mirror (DM) and via a mechanically switchable mirror (FM) sent either to a spectrometer or to a beamsplitter (BS) followed by two APDs in a HBT-configuration.

\end{figure*}

We identify NV centers in bulk diamond at room-temperature in a home-build confocal microscope setup (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig2-nvstruct}a). By scanning the sample and collecting the fluorescence signal with a single photodiode (APD) we find multiple diffraction limited spots, corresponding to NV centers (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig2-nvstruct}b). Here we off-resonantly excite the NV center to a phonon level above the $^3E$ level, which quickly decays non-radiatively to $^3E$. The reflections of the excitation are separated from the fluorescence with a dicroic mirror. The emission spectrum from $^3E$ is show in Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig2-nvstruct}c. It shows a distinct peak around 637 nm, corresponding to the direct decay from $^3E$ to $^3A_2$ (zero phonon line, ZPL) and a broad sideband corresponding to the decay to a phonon level above $^3A_2$ (phonon side band, PSB). To verify that the signal originates from a single emitter, we measure the second-order autocorrelation function $g^2 (\tau)$ in a Hanbury-Brown-Twiss configuration (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig2-nvstruct}d). The low probability of simultaneous photon detection ($g^2 (\tau = 0) < 1/2$) confirms that the signal comes from a single emitter.

\section{Single NV center device}

To enhance the collection and excitation efficiency of the NV center, a solid-immersion lens (SIL) is milled in the diamond using a focused ion beam (FIB) \cite{Hadden__2010,Marseglia__2011,Bernien__2014,Jamali__2014} (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig3-device}a). For an NV center in the middle of the SIL, the hemisphere ensures that the emission from the NV center reaches the diamond-air surface at normal incidence. This significantly reduces the loss due to total-internal reflection. For precise placement of the SIL, a pre-characterized NV center is located with respect to 1x1 $\mu$m gold markers that are fabricated on the surface of the diamond using electron beam lithography. The hemisphere structure is then created using a gallium ion beam by milling concentric rings of varying diameter around the position of the NV center. After milling the SILs, the sample is cleaned for 30 minutes in a boiling mixture of equal parts of perchloric, sulforic and nitric acid. This step removes the redeposited material during milling. A small conductive layer of gallium atoms that is implanted during the FIB process is removed by reactive-ion etching in an oxygen-plasma.

A 200 nm thick gold microwave strip line for spin manipulation (Fig \ref{fig:tam-fig7-erabi} and \ref{fig:tam-fig10-nrabi}) and DC gates to DC stark shift the ZPL (see chapter \ref{ch:LDE}) are  fabricated near the SIL using electron beam lithography. Finally a single-layer anti-reflection coating\cite{Yeung__2012} (aluminium oxide) is fabricated on top of the sample to further increase the collection efficiency and reduce the reflection during resonant excitation (see chapter \ref{ch:LDE}).

\section{Addressing the electron excited state}
\label{sec:opticalcontrol}

The spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions introduce a fine splitting to the $^3E$ excited state which can be observed at cryogenic temperatures. The six resulting transitions have a distinct spin character (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig4-laserscan}a) and allow for spin-selective optical excitation of the electron. The transitions to the $m_s = 0$ states ($E_x$ and $E_y$) can occur upon absoprtion or emission of a linearly polarized photon, while the four $m_s = \pm 1$ transitions couple to circularly polarized light. The transition frequencies shift when an electric field or strain is applied. For an electric field along the N-V axis this results in an offset to the spectrum, not changing the energy level spacing. A perpendicular electric field affects the difference between the energy levels. As a result, the spectrum of the excited state slightly varies between NV centers due to local differences in strain and electric field. In Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig4-laserscan}b we show measurements of the spectra of three different NV centres, normalized to have the same parallel strain. The lateral strain is determined from the difference between the transition energies of $E_x$ and $E_y$. The spectra show excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction (dashed lines). The strain typically differs a few tens of GHz between NV centers measured in this thesis.

	\centering
	\includegraphics{laserscans}
	\caption{\label{fig:tam-fig4-laserscan} \textbf{Spectrum of the excited state} (a) Energy level diagram of the fine structure of the excited states. There are two levels with spin $m_s = 0$ ($E_x$,$E_y$) and four $m_s = \pm 1$ levels ($A_1$,$A_2$,$E_1$ and $E_2$). At finite strain the degeneracies between $E_x$,$E_y$ and $E_1$,$E_2$ are lifted. (b) The energy spectrum for three different NV centers is measured by varying the frequency of the excitation laser and detecting the fluorescence in the PSB. The observed transitions $E_1$ (blue), $E_2$ (red), $E_y$ (green), $E_x$ (purple), $A_1$ (orange) and $A_2$ (brown) are color coded and agree well with the theoretical prediction (colored dashed lines). For each scan the transition energies $\Delta E_x$ and $\Delta E_y$ are determined to calculate the lateral ($\frac{\Delta E_x-\Delta E_y}{2}$) and parallel ($\frac{\Delta E_y+\Delta E_x}{2}$) strain. The parallel strain is then substracted for each scan. Laser frequency is with respect to 470.4 THz.}
\end{figure*}

To address the spin-selective optical transitions in an experiment, we first verify that the NV center is in the $NV^-$ state and that the lasers are resonant with the desired transitions before each experimental run. During this charge-resonance (CR) check, we simultaneously apply two red lasers and monitor the fluorescence (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig4-cr}a). The lasers can only excite the electron spin for the NV center in $NV^-$ and the number of detected photons is highest when one red lasers is resonant with a $m_s = 0$ transition and the other with a $m_s=\pm1$ transition. We therefore compare the signal to a threshold and only continue with the experimental sequence when the threshold is passed (Fig. \ref{fig:tam-fig4-cr}b). When the number of detected photons is below the threshold we apply a green (523 nm) laser, perform another CR check and repeat until success. The green laser can repump the center to $NV^-$ by exciting trapped charges in the environment, but also induces spectral diffusion of the optical transitions since the local electric field is affected by the charge configuration in the environment. As an alternative to the green laser, a yellow laser ($\lambda \approx 575$ nm) can be used to resonantly excite the $NV^0$ zero phonon line \cite{Siyushev_Phys.Rev.Lett._2013}.

The process is controlled by an ADwin microprocessor which turns on the two red lasers and compares the number of photons detected by the avalanche photodiode (APD) to a predetermined threshold (verify stage). When the number of detected photons is below the threshold a green laser is applied to prepare the $NV^-$ state (repump stage), otherwise the experimental sequence is initiated. (b) Photon number distribution during the verification stage, conditioned on the previous CR check being successful. }

The electron spin is initialized by selectively exciting a single transition\cite{Robledo_Nature_2011}: $E_x$ or $E_y$ to prepare $m_s = \pm 1$ or $A_1$/$A_2$/$E'$ to prepare $m_s=0$. The slight spin mixing of the excited states provides an optical pumping mechanism to prepare the opposite spin state (\ref{fig:tam-fig5-SP})a). The fluorescence observed during initialization (\ref{fig:tam-fig5-SP})b) exponentially decreases with the probability that the spin has flipped to a dark state that can not be excited by the pumping laser. The signal is fitted to an exponential decay to extract a lower bound for the preparation fidelity. To ensure that a pure state is prepared (as opposed to a mixture of $m_s = \pm 1$) the electron spin is typically initialized in $m_s = 0$, for this state we find a lower bound of $(99.7 \pm 0.1) \%$.

	\caption{\label{fig:tam-fig5-SP} Figure from \cite{Bernien__2014} \textbf{Initialization by spin pumping} (a) Energy levels used to initialize (and readout) the electron spin. We excite transitions with a well-defined spin character of either $m_s = 0$ (bright arrows) or $m_s= \pm 1$ (dark arrows), resulting in spin-conserving optical cycling (indicated by bended solid arrows). Dashed arrows indicate the spin non-conserving decay paths. (b) Observed fluorescence when exciting $E_x$ ($A_1$) with the spin initially prepared in $m_s = \pm 1$ ($m_s = 0$). The signal is fitted to a single exponential with an offset to account for dark counts. From the fit we find a lower limit for the initialization fidelities: $(99.7 \pm 0.1) \%$ for $m_s = 0$ and $(99.2 \pm 0.1) \%$ for $m_s=\pm 1$.}
\end{figure*}

The observed fluorescence upon selective excitation provides a means to detect the electron spin state in a single shot\cite{Robledo_Nature_2011}. To characterize the readout we plot the distribution of photons detected in the PSB collected during a 10 $\mu s$ laser pulse exciting $E_x$ (fig \ref{fig:tam-fig6-ssro}a). The distributions are clearly separated depending on the initial spin state, allowing us to assign $m_s = 0$ to the cases where one or more photons are detected and $m_s = \pm 1$ otherwise. The combined readout and initialization fidelity for $m_s = \pm 1$ ($F_1 = .989 \pm .001$) is reduced by detector dark counts and off-resonant excitation, while for $m_s = 0$ ($F_1 = .956 \pm .003$) the error is governed by the instances where the spin is flipped before a photon is detected. This can be seen in fig \ref{fig:tam-fig6-ssro}b where the readout fidelities are plotted as a function of readout duration. The fidelity for $m_s = 0$ initially increases with readout time and then saturates indicating that the spin has flipped with high probability. The optimal mean readout fidelity ($F_{ro} = \frac{F_0+F_1}{2} = 0.973 \pm 0.002$) is reached after $10 \mu s$.

\section{Ground state spin control and coherence}

In the orbital ground state, the $m_s = 0$ and $m_s = \pm 1$ states are separated by the zero-field splitting $D \approx 2.88$ GHz, while an external magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between $m_s = +1$ and $-1$ via the zeeman splitting. The hamiltonian is given by

\begin{equation}
H_{GS} = D^2 S_z + \gamma_e \mathbf{B} \cdot \mathbf{S}
\end{equation}

with $\mathbf{S} =[S_x,S_y,S_z]$,  $S_i$ the pauli spin matrices for a spin-1 particle and $\gamma_e = 2.8$ MHz/G the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron. We define our qubit in the $m_s = 0 :\ket{0}$ and $m_s = -1 : \ket{1}$ states (alternatively the $m_s = + 1$ state can be used to encode $\ket{1}$). The electron spin is manipulated with electron spin resonance techniques by sending an ac current through the stripline generating an oscillating magnetic field at the location of the NV center. At the resonance condition the frequency of the control field matches the energy difference between the $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ states resulting in coherent Rabi oscillations between those levels as shown in fig \ref{fig:tam-fig7-erabi}. Arbitrary qubit rotations are implemented by calibrating the amplitude (which sets the rabi frequency) and length of the control pulses.
