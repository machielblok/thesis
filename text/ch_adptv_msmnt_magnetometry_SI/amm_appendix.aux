We initialize the electron spin in $m_s = 0$ and then vary the frequency of a microwave pulse with fixed length. The pulse detuning is with respect to a reference frequency of 2.845334 GHz. The spectrum shows three lines owing to the hyperfine interaction with the $^{14}$N spin with $|A_{hf}| = 2\pi x (2.185 \pm 0.006)$ MHz. c) Rabi oscillation of the electron spin unconditional on the state of the nitrogen spin.
