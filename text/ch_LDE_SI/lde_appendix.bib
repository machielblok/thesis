abstract = {We report on the observation of quantum interference of the emission from two separate nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Taking advantage of optically induced spin polarization in combination with polarization filtering, we isolate a single transition within the zero-phonon line of the nonresonantly excited NV centers. The time-resolved two-photon interference contrast of this filtered emission reaches 66%. Furthermore, we observe quantum interference from dissimilar NV centers tuned into resonance through the dc Stark effect. These results pave the way towards measurement-based entanglement between remote NV centers and the realization of quantum networks with solid-state spins.},

abstract = {We describe a technique for fabricating micro- and nanostructures incorporating fluorescent defects in diamond with a positional accuracy better than hundreds of nanometers. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy and focused ion beam etching, we initially locate a suitable defect with respect to registration marks on the diamond surface then etch a structure using these coordinates. We demonstrate the technique by etching an 8 Î¼m diameter hemisphere positioned with single negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy defect lies at its origin. Direct comparison of the fluorescence photon count rate before and after fabrication shows an eightfold increase due to the presence of the hemisphere.},

abstract = {Understanding and controlling the complex environment of solid-state quantum bits is a central challenge in spintronics and quantum information science. Coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin associated with a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond was used to gain insight into its local environment. We show that this environment is effectively separated into a set of individual proximal 13C nuclear spins, which are coupled coherently to the electron spin, and the remainder of the 13C nuclear spins, which cause the loss of coherence. The proximal nuclear spins can be addressed and coupled individually because of quantum back-action from the electron, which modifies their energy levels and magnetic moments, effectively distinguishing them from the rest of the nuclei. These results open the door to coherent manipulation of individual isolated nuclear spins in a solid-state environment even at room temperature.},

abstract = {The efficiency of photon collection from optically active defect centers in bulk diamond is greatly reduced by refraction at the diamond-air interface. We report on the fabrication and measurement of a geometrical solution to the problem; integrated solid immersion lenses (SILs) etched directly into the surface of diamond. An increase of a factor of 10 was observed in the saturated count-rate from a single negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) within a 5 Î¼m diameter SIL compared with NV-'s under a planar surface in the same crystal. Such a system is potentially scalable and easily adaptable to other defect centers in bulk diamond.},
